# Youtube

You can follow my installation of this iso on vmware and see me installing all desktops, installing all icons and changing settings in the various desktop managers. Writing down all the sardi icons I should still make or fix.

# Update your system.

This is my way of working when installing a new operating system.

First upgrade kernel and install drivers.

If everything is still working we can install the software and start customizing the system.






# Software installation



The best of them

	Atom					--use script
	Sublime Text			--use script
	Variety					--normal repo
	Inkscape				--normal repo
	Plank					--normal repo
	Screenfetch				--normal repo

# Sardi Icon Theme
-------------------

This icon theme can be downloaded at  sourceforge.

http://sourceforge.net/projects/sardi/

For ease of installation I use the script


	- icons-sardi-vx.sh

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename
